## Bellabeat Case Study

**Project description:** In this case study I am a data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. 

Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 

My job is to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.

### 1. Ask

In this analysis, we study existing trends in smart products and make an informed recommendation to guide the marketing strategy for a specific Bellabeat product. 

The key stakeholders for this analysis are Urška Sršen (Co-founder and CCO) and the Bellabeat marketing analytics team. Sršen assigned this project and will make a final decision based on our analysis. We are a part of the Bellabeat marketing team, and our work reflects on our team members.

### 2. Prepare

I downlaoded the FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset (by Mobius) from Kaggle and stored it in ‘Prepare’ folder within the ‘Case Study 2’ folder on my Desktop. 

The dataset is downloaded as a file named ‘Fitbase Data 4.12.16 – 5.12.16’. The files within are .csv files. Most of the data is stored in the long format, some are in wide format. 

To determine the credibility of the data I looked at reliability, originality, comprehensiveness, how up to date it is, and citability. 

The reliability of the data checks out as it is collected objectively from thirty Fitbit users. My only concern is that this is a small sample size, and we would have liked data from a range of smart fitness devices to get a good overall understanding of the market. 

The data is collected firsthand and therefore I am confident in its originality.
