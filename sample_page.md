## Bellabeat Case Study

**Project description:** In this case study I am a data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. My job is to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.
