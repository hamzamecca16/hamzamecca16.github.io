## Bellabeat Case Study

**Project description:** In this case study I am a data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. 

Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 

My job is to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.

### 1. Ask

In this analysis, we study existing trends in smart products and make an informed recommendation to guide the marketing strategy for a specific Bellabeat product. 

The key stakeholders for this analysis are Urška Sršen (Co-founder and CCO) and the Bellabeat marketing analytics team. Sršen assigned this project and will make a final decision based on our analysis. We are a part of the Bellabeat marketing team, and our work reflects on our team members.
